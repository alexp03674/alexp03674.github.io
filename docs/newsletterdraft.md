# Art Vs. Technology: Does it Have to be a Competition?
_If you have any experience with the painting vs. technology debate or have seen any cool examples of that before, I'd be interested to know your perspective on this topic._

Technology is killing physical art. That idea is something I, and probably most of you, have seen floating around social media. The question that introduced the topic for this article even phrased it as the "painting vs. technology debate.” But I believe the societal trend of thinking AI will kill art and creativity is an overreaction, which is caused by a general misunderstanding of how technology and fine art have interacted throughout history. 

At the start of the 2020s, AI began to advance exponentially faster than ever before, with [companies investing billions of dollars into development](https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report/economy); and since the rise of ChatGPT’s popularity in 2022, people have become concerned as to how generative AI would start to affect life - especially art. [Some people even jumped to the conclusion that AI would kill creativity and art.](https://www.facebook.com/groups/281441667398958/posts/1160747799468336/) With that said, the focus of this article will entirely be on fine art instead of art focused jobs (like graphic designers).

## Historical Uses of Technology in Art

While it is obviously impossible to tell the future, looking towards the past can give clues as to how artists will interact with AI. When photography was invented, French painter Paul Delaroche saw one for the first time and said that [“from today, painting is dead”](https://www.barnesfoundation.org/whats-on/early-photography#:~:text=On%20first%20seeing%20a%20photograph,in%20the%20mid-19th%20century) Delaroche may not have been entirely wrong. Impressionism, expressionism, and abstractism all emerged post-photography, favoring a less photo realistic style.

Regardless, painting continued to grow in popularity, with artists like [Picasso](https://www.pablopicasso.org/) becoming household names. Photography did not kill painting, it simply changed it, with [photography becoming its own artform](https://aaronhertzmann.com/2022/08/29/photography-history). I believe AI will similarly lead to a transformation within art. 

Another thing to note is how other contemporary technologies have worked their way into art. Many artists have created mixed media gallery [exhibitions, where traditional and digital works coexist,](https://www.saic.edu/magazine/fall21/a-virtual-existence) or are even the backbone of the exhibition. Some examples include artists using LED lights or TV screens to enhance the gallery experience.

Collaboration between contemporary technology and art has only expanded the potential for art creation, as traditional painters still find themselves at the heart of [artistic discourse.](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-contemporary-painters-channeling-luxe-lifes-dutch-golden-age) Maybe AI will take on a role like these technologies, where it is used in tandem with physical artwork to produce something new. 

## AI as a Tool for Artists

On the other hand, AI could be used to assist artists during the creative process. Someone could always use AI unethically, but there is potential for it to be used as a teacher or a sounding board for ideas. Personally, I have explored using AI to learn about new techniques and ways of applying paint, which I found to be much easier than combing through YouTube or articles.

Many people think art comes naturally through talent, but talent is a pursued interest, involving consistent hard work. AI could allow people to more easily pursue art and grow into incredible physical artists, because, at the end of the day, [people still need physical art.](https://www.teravarna.com/post/why-physical-art-exhibitions-are-needed) 

## The Future of Physical Art

Physical art exists all around us: in houses, on city walls, in restaurants. Physical presence cannot be replicated. And this is something that many people agree on, with [younger generations even trending back towards analog technology.](https://vogueadria.com/offline-analog-trend/) While it is sad to see AI art in things like graphics, commercials, and [in stores like Hobby Lobby](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/1f4xqfc/ai_generated_art_sold_at_hobby_lobby/), there will always be a market for physical works.

So, going back to the title of this article, does there need to be a competition between AI and physical art? I don’t think so. Hopefully they can coexist. I understand people’s hesitation towards AI, nor do I often use it myself. But I enjoy seeing new things in art. Nobody wants to look at the same Monet paintings all the time, even if they are great. Maybe the rise of AI art will drive artists to produce some of humanity’s greatest masterpieces, whether they collaborate with it or not.
