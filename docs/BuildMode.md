## Build Mode

So, you made your sim and are ready to release them into the world! But wait—they need a house first!

### Getting Started 

After exiting CAS, the game prompts you to pick a world to live in. It doesn’t matter which world you pick—your sim can always move later.
Once you’ve selected your world, choose a lot to move your sim into. 

Empty lots let you build your house with your remaining funds whereas built lots let you purchase a pre-furnished or unfurnished home. If you don’t like the layout, you can change it in BM; it’s completely customizable! (Just keep an eye on your funds).

🗒️ **NOTE:** Your sim’s household always starts with 20,000 Simoleons. 

### Build Mode Features

Alright! You’ve bought your lot and moved in! The game drops your sim into LM, and you can’t modify your home from this mode. To access BM, click the hammer and wrench icon in the top right menu. 

🗒️ **NOTE:** When you enter BM, your sim and time will pause.

Wow, that’s a lot of stuff on the screen! No worries, we detail each feature below.

#### The Grid

There will be a white grid surrounding the floor of your lot. This is the buildable area, and the tiles that items will align to. It ensures the walls of your home and the items within don’t interrupt sims movements through the space.

To hide the grid, press G.
#### The Tool Bar

The [Lot Info Panel](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Build_mode_(The_Sims_4)%23Lot_info_panel&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1762210371031428&usg=AOvVaw2ve_Xd6JRcPTVs_oAE9vaI), at the top left of the screen, contains essential information about your lot, including lot type, dimensions, value, and [traits and challenges](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Lot_traits_and_challenges%23Base_game&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1762210371025491&usg=AOvVaw3uqvaE7QEkouG6WgvGCKlh).
#### Build Buy Menu

The Build Buy Menu is the large panel at the bottom left of your screen with three categories. You can switch between categories by clicking on their respective icons flush to the left side of the menu. 
>* [Build Catalog](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Build_mode_(The_Sims_4)%23Build&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1762210371031774&usg=AOvVaw2rNeFlzT3p8qsdfuc88mOS) (house icon): It’s the first tab opened when you enter BM, with a large interactive house image, and is the primary directory for items relevant to exterior decor and foundational building.
>* Objects-by-Room (chair-in-a-box icon): It brings up a large interactive image of a kitchen setting. To move between rooms, click the related icons located above the interactive image.
>* Objects-by-Function (single chair icon): It contains a drop down menu to select specific functions, like surface or plumbing. 
>
💡**TIP**:  You can resell any purchased item with the sledgehammer. 
### Common Questions
There are many aspects to BM, so here are a few questions you might ask yourself as you’re exploring BM.

>*“I want to push this object against the wall, but the game won’t let me. Why?”*

The game is particular about where items can go. To place objects without constraints, pull up the **cheat window** by pressing **CTRL + Shift + C**. In the pop-up bar, type **“bb.moveobjects on”** to place objects wherever. Check out this [cheats guide](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.carls-sims-4-guide.com/cheats.php%23google_vignette&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1762210371015582&usg=AOvVaw1nvujEQdVT5h7XAqjTF76N) for a longer, detailed explanation of available cheats and what they do.

💡**TIP**: Freely placing objects might impact their functionality. Play-test in LM when building with cheats.

>*“Woah, I just went down a floor level, and it’s really dark. What is this?”*

Welcome to the **basement**! Basement levels function the same as your above-ground levels. It’s important to note that **you must build a room in the basement level before you can place objects**. Also, ensure you have a staircase otherwise your basement will be inaccessible!

>*“There’s an object in the world that I really like, but I can’t find it in BM. Why?”*

The object is likely a part of the **debug menu**. Debug items are used in world, but not available for purchase in BM. However, using cheats lets you access these items for free in BM. See this [debug guide](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gamesradar.com/the-sims-4-debug-cheat/&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1762210371016101&usg=AOvVaw3UgFpwg4F91T4yNLu2M4tj) for a better look at how to use it.
