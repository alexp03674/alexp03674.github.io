## Live Mode
You have your character and house, and now you’re ready to play as your sim! Here’s what to know about LM.

### Controlling Sims 
Look at your beautiful sim! Uh-Oh, where are they? If you can’t find them in the world, **left-click their portrait** in the household panel. To follow them, **right click their household portrait**.

You can only control one sim at a time — switch between sims by **left clicking their household portraits**.

You aren’t just here to watch your sim — you’re here to play as them! 

>* Click on sims in the world to see available interactions with them.
>* Your sim's actions will queue in the order you choose them, and the icons  appear in the bottom left corner.
>* Some actions continue until you tell your sim to stop by left clicking the action icon.
>* Actions with the orange circle are instant actions done by the player.  
![In-game action that says "Send Home" with an orange circle beside it](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkuhXZdJZe.jpg)

>* When your sim leaves a location without you following them, their household portrait grays out. Click the two-person icon in their portrait to see available actions.

🗒️ **NOTE:** Around each action icon will be a progress circle, showing time until completion.

### Needs
What do we want? Needs! When do we want them? Now!

![Panel showing a sim's needs in bars with differing fullness. Needs include bladder, fun, hunger, social, energy, and hygiene](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1lb6ZvJ-x.jpg)

The Needs tab is in the Utility Panel (UP) at the bottom right of the screen. Based on a sim’s needs, they will gain moodlets that determine their [emotional state](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Emotion&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1762210371039777&usg=AOvVaw2YVXOo8Vq47e6gaLnxAhvG), displayed under their character portrait. Moodlets result from actions, events, and in-game experiences.

>* To satisfy a sim’s needs, queue actions related to the specific need.
>>* Ex. Have them eat to satisfy their hunger. 
>* If you fail to satisfy a sim’s needs, there may be consequences.
>>* If they are too tired, they may faint!
### Wants and Aspirations
You chose an aspiration for your sim when you made them, and to see the tasks to complete it, click the **gold icon** in the UP. 


💡**TIP**:  Completing the aspiration allows you to pick a new one for your sim and grants them a longer lifespan!


**Wants** are the thought bubbles above your sim's character portrait. There are no consequences for not fulfilling these or aspirations.

>* Wants go away on their own unless you **pin them** by clicking the pushpin near them.
>* Completing a want or aspiration grants you aspiration points. 
>>* To spend these, go to the **Aspiration** tab and click “Rewards Store.”
>* The [Rewards Store](https://discover.hubpages.com/games-hobbies/The-Sims-4-Walkthrough-Rewards-Store-Guide) has items and traits you may purchase for the selected sim. 
### Skills 
Some wants and aspirations involve learning skills! 

>* Your sim’s skills and their levels are under the **Skills** tab in the UP.
>>* Don’t fret if this is blank! BM contains items that increase skills, or your sim can purchase a book on a skill. 
>>>* To buy a book, click on any bookshelf. 

>* Reaching higher levels of skills unlocks new abilities.
>* When your sim does a skill-increasing action, a bar appears above their head to show skill progress.
>>* Most skill actions will only stop when you cancel the action.

💡**TIP**: The **Handiness** skill is obtained through fixing items. If your sim attempts to fix an electronic after already being electrocuted by it, they will die on the second attempt. Save your game before fixing electronics with a low Handiness skill!

Some skills and their objects include Comedy (microphone), Gaming (computer), and Painting (easel). Check out this [list of skills](https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_skills_%28The_Sims_4%29#The_Sims_4_-_Base_Game) your sim can achieve.

### Careers
Let’s get to work! If you don’t want a traditional career for your sim, they can use skills for profit, such as selling paintings or publishing books.

Want a 9-5? Click the **Career** tab, the briefcase icon in the UP, to find a job!

![Pop-up menu showing sim career options, including astronaut, athlete, etc.](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hk4C6bw1Wg.jpg)

Once you select a career, you can find your sim’s progress towards a promotion and their work schedule in the *Career* tab.
>* Jobs have tasks to do before every shift if you want your sim to progress faster in their career.
>* Sims will go to work on their own. If you cancel the action, send them to work by clicking “Go to Work” in the **Career** tab. 
>>* Being late or missing work will lower your sim's work performance; if their performance is too low, they’ll be demoted.

Clicking the two-person icon on a household portrait provides actions for your sim at work that will affect their performance. **Working hard** increases a sim’s work performance while **socializing** increases relationships. Hover over the different options to see details.

### Relationships
Your sim is flourishing. A job, skills, and a house—now all they need are some friends!

>* When you interact with a sim, a bar at the top of the screen shows your sim’s relationship with them.
![Box including a sim's portrait in the top left, and a bar beneath showing relationship progress](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJrdRWDkZg.jpg)
>>* Green is friendship, pink is romance, red is dislike.

Interactions will affect the relationship progression differently depending on the conversational likes of the sim you’re interacting with.
>* Ex. When Mischief interactions are performed on a sim that dislikes Mischief, friendship will decrease.

💡**TIP**: When romance is low with another sim, bold romantic interactions, like a pick-up line, are unlikely to succeed. 

### Events and Traveling 
Events are one of many features that allow you to meet other sims. The first event you encounter is the Welcome Wagon.

>* The Welcome Wagon prompts your sim’s neighbors to come meet you, their new neighbor! 
>>* Your neighbors will bring a fruitcake as a gift. The fruitcake is infamous in the Sims community. Don’t let your sim eat it or they’ll gain an uncomfortable moodlet for the rest of the day.

For all events, like the Welcome Wagon, there will be an icon and panel in the top left corner. 

![Pop-up panel describing the Welcome Wagon event](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJMxffDJZg.jpg)
>* If you complete the tasks for an event, your sim may receive a reward.

💡**TIP**: Not all events will have tasks. If your sim is invited to an event, there will be no tasks to complete.

>* If you wish to end an event early, click the timer icon in the event panel.

Events include dates, parties, weddings, and more. You can start an event by using the phone located below the character portrait. 

Traveling is another way to get out and meet other sims. To **travel**, click on your sim or phone and find the “travel” button.
>* You will be given the choice to travel alone or with other sims!
>* When traveling to another sim’s house, their icon will be translucent if they’re not home and opaque if they are.
>* Click the home icon on a sim’s household portrait to send them home.
>* You will have to do this for each sim in your household that you want to send home if they are traveling together.
